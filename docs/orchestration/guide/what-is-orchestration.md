# What is orchestration?
Orchestration embodies the communication with multiple service providers through a single API. This capability is crucial for decoupling your services from the core of your application, leading to enhanced maintainability, scalability, and reliability. By abstracting the complexity of interacting with various providers, Orchestration ensures your application's architecture remains robust and adaptable to changing service landscapes.

## Why Payavel?
The journey of Payavel began with the inception of [payavel/checkout](https://github.com/payavel/checkout), an open-source Laravel package designed to simplify payment processes. As we ventured further, we conceptualized a subscription package to complement our existing offerings by providing robust subscription management tools. It was during this phase that we recognized a common foundational layer shared between these packages, a layer ripe for extraction and standalone use.

Before finalizing [payavel/subscription](https://github.com/payavel/subscription), we decided to first extract and refine this shared foundation. This insight led to the creation of [payavel/orchestration](https://github.com/payavel/orchestration), a package crafted to empower the Laravel community by providing a versatile tool for service integration. Our mission with orchestration is not just to offer a solution but to contribute to a more interconnected and efficient development environment within the Laravel framework.
