# Features
Orchestration offers a suite of features designed to streamline service integration and management in Laravel applications:

1. **Unified Service API**: Integrate multiple service providers through a single API, simplifying the way you interact with external services.
2. **Auto-Generated Service Scaffolding**: Jumpstart your service integration with pre-generated templates that outline the core structure, allowing for quick customization and implementation.
3. **Flexible Multi-Driver Support**: Seamlessly switch between different service providers or accounts using orchestration's multi-driver capability, including support for custom drivers tailored to your specific needs.
4. **Pre-Configured for Efficiency**: Comes with sensible defaults and basic configurations to get you started, reducing the initial setup time and complexity.
5. **Mocking for Streamlined Testing**: Enhance your testing workflow with built-in mocking capabilities, allowing for effective simulation of external service responses without live dependencies.

## Developer Experience
Orchestration is crafted with the Developer Experience (DX) at its core, focusing on efficiency, flexibility, and simplicity:

- Simplified Integration Process: The unified service API and auto-generated scaffolding reduce the cognitive load on developers, making it easier to integrate and manage multiple services.
- Enhanced Flexibility and Customization: With multi-driver support and the ability to use custom drivers, developers have the freedom to adapt the package to a wide range of scenarios, ensuring that it fits the unique requirements of their projects.
- Reduced Boilerplate and Setup Time: The pre-configured nature of orchestration and its sensible defaults minimize the initial setup effort, allowing developers to focus more on building features rather than configuring services.
- Improved Testing and Reliability: The mocking capabilities baked into orchestration enable thorough testing of service integrations in isolation, contributing to higher reliability and confidence in the application's functionality.

By emphasizing these aspects, orchestration not only enhances the technical capabilities of Laravel applications but also significantly improves the overall development experience, making service integration a seamless and enjoyable process.
